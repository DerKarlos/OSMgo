INSTALL


npm install --save three
npm install --save-dev vite

npm install three ???
npm install chroma-js
npm install jquery ???

vite will generate a comressed dispatch version. Nice!

"Installation added node_modules/ and package.json to my project. What are they?"
Well, not at once but in a later attempt, node_modules/ apeared with a lot of content
and package.json even was overwritten, as it was only "type": "module" in it anyway

npx vite
It firstly did not start because of many errors in my code. Thats fine.
I would like to see this errors in VSCode too please!

npx vite build
generates a dir dist for Distribution

USEFULL: quick-lint-js better? replaces? than ESLint




TEST-Caos

For the (with "npx vite build") comprimated file "/dist/assets/index-CXnk0FmV.js"
"quick-lint-js" draws warnings:
misleading use of ',' operator in conditional statement
The causing code may be from a three.js file:
if (e.applyMatrix3(this.matrix), e.x < 0 || e.x > 1)

Building the /dist with "npx vite build" causes some warnings like this:
main.js (462:33): "LightShadow" is not exported by "node_modules/three/build/three.module.js", imported by "main.js".
"new THREE.LightShadow" causes no problems in the source files while "quick-lint-js" and broswer test by localhost:5173/dist
Testing with the sources, it realy is not know. But "THREE.PerspectiveCamera" is known
